We will build Rest Apis that can create, retrieve, update, delete and find Tutorials by title.

The following table shows overview of the Rest APIs that will be exported:

- POST    `api/tickets`                                           add new Tickets
- GET     `api/tickets/?page_number = 0 & page_size = 10`         get Tickets with pagination
```
npm install
```
### Run
```
node server.js
```
